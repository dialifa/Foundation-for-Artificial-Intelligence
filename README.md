Number 1
I Want to Withdraw All My Savings in Cash!
As we know, in Indonesia there are several denominations of money as follows:
Paper Money:
Rp 100,000
Rp 50,000
Rp 20,000
Rp 10,000
Rp 5,000
Rp 2,000
Coins:
Rp 1,000
Rp 500
Rp 200
Rp 100

*To make it easier, we assume that all Rp. 1000 denominations are coins.
There are circumstances where the bank must liquidate all customer savings in the form of money, if the customer requests it.
And imagine this is happening right now in front of you, help the bank to calculate how many denominations of money are needed.
Here is the rule:
1. Banks must prioritize the largest denominations first to be issued.
2. If there is a balance that cannot be cashed, the bank must inform it.
3. Bank must calculate how many number of Paper Money needed and Coins needed.
4. Banks can only disburse a maximum amount of 1 billion Rupiah.
The output is telling the bank:
1. How many Rp 100,000 , Rp 50,000 , Rp 20,000 and so on needed to fulfill the request.
2. How many number of Paper Money and Coins needed (sum of paper money and coins).
3. What is the amount that cannot be cashed.
